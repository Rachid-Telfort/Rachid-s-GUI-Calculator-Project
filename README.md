Rachidâ€™s GUI Calculator README

About
  This project was a personal project based on my readings and advice from a tech interview on binary expression trees. The project consisted of implementing a virtual calculator using Java swing and using binary expression trees to parse and evaluate the expressions the user types on the calculator GUI. The project will have 4 calculation modes based on the four common bases that a programmer or computer scientist uses. The four modes are binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. As of right now only the binary mode is implemented. The other modes will be implemented later. I thought the binary mode would be useful to some people so I decided to upload it and share.

Source Code Use
  The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions/questions relating to the source code, please comment on the project page or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Runnable JAR File Use
  The runnable JAR file is free for anyone to use. To run the current implementation of the GUI Calculator just click on the JAR file and it will run. To access the various options the GUI Calculator provides, simply hover the mouse over the corresponding button or menu item and a short description of what that particular button or menu item does and the keyboard shortcut to access will show. To see an example usage of the GUI Calculator, download the short video associated with the project. I believe a video will make someone understand the program much better than me writing a detailed description of what each part of the GUI Calculator does.
  
Final Notes
  I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. I learned much about binary expression trees and refreshed my knowledge of Java swing. I also want to thank the interviewer for telling me about binary expression trees. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
